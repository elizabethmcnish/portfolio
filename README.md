1. ML Dashboard
    * This tool has been created for modelling the datasets on UK road accidents
        * This data is currently just for 2023, but will be expanded to include the past 5 years
    * To run this tool locally on your machine, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```python
    streamlit run App.py
    ```

    * Feel free to play around with the input variables (features), and try to optimise the model as much as possible!
